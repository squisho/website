I am a software developer with a passion for user-centric design.  Having studied both Computer Science and Psychology in my undergraduate studies, I take from a wide berth of knowledge and incorporate concepts from both to my design philosophy.  I have worked as a full stack software developer and have spent time building and deploying ML models.  I love data visualizations and enjoy making rich, interactive visualizations both as salient educative tools and also as interesting, artful experiences.
